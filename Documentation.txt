For creating instance aws instance follow youtube : https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vmty50KJg08 (Koding 101)

While creating SSH key value pair, make sure to chmod permissions (refer to SSH connections in instance creation in aws)

clone the git repo to the remote aws ec2 instance
in the instance, there is apps folder under which all webapps are stored

make sure to npm install in both client and server
every time there is a change in clinet, make sure to npm run build in client

for old react make sure to inclue legacy command in package.json. refer to package.json of client

we are starting the client from server only by sending a response with the index.html under the clinet/build folder
so we dont need to separately npm start for client and server
Here we only npm start in server.

in the aws instsance, our app is live while npm start is executed in server.
but it collapses as soon as we log out of instance.
so we use pm2 to always run the server.
use command: pm2 run index.js --name chatapp (in server folder)
some more cmds for pm2 : for details of pm2 sites: pm2 list 
                         to delete pm2 site: pm2 delete 0(this deletes all sites)

for this project, the public ipv4 address is not showing on laptop due to securtiy issues, but working fine on mobile browser

We are serving this with NGINX server. The default port of nginx is 80
Public ipv4 of app : 52.66.244.228
Live Site Link : 52.66.244.228:80

In socket of client/src/components/Chat/Chat.js, ENDPOINT should contain the live link of the deployed server. 
for local machine, the server is hosted on localhost:5001, so ENDPOINT is localhost:5001
but in case of aws instance, the live server link is 52.66.244.228, so ENDPOINT is 52.66.244.228
