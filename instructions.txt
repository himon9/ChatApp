1. For a dynamic application, there is always two parts : client and server
2. In the client side, link the port where the server is running say localhost:8000
3. Create a build of client
4. Serve with pm2 : pm2 serve build 3000 --spa --name client (where 3000 is the port where we want to run client)
5. Navigate to server folder and run : pm2 start index.js --name server
6. Thus the two parts are running separately and the server is connected to the clinet
7. In the default file, located at ./etc/nginx/sites-available, change the nginx config and add the following lines to bypass the http traffic to our client side

    server_name _;

	location / {
		proxy_pass http://localhost:3000; // client port
		proxy_http_version 1.1;
		proxy_set_header Upgrade $http_upgrade;
		proxy_set_header Connection 'upgrade';
		proxy_set_header Host $host;
		proxy_cache_bypass $http_upgrade;
	}

8. After any changes, always restart nginx server by : sudo service nginx restart
9. If we stop our ec2 instance, then we need to again run pm2 commands
10. Our site is live on public ipv4 provided by aws ec2 instance 



inside the server dir , run : pm2 start index.js
To stop pm2 : "pm2 stop appname" or "pm2 kill"
Here we are starting both server and client from index.js of server , cmd : "npm start"

access aws ec2 by:
ssh -i "ChatAppSSH.pem" ubuntu@ec2-52-66-244-228.ap-south-1.compute.amazonaws.com
